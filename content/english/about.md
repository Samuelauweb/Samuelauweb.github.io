It's Samuel, Front-End Web Developer. After graduated with a  degree in commerce, I started to work as a rehab fitness trainer in fitness industry. I enjoy the process to help people achieving their fitness goals.
<br><br>
Like many others, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has had a big impact on my career, which I had started to develop an interest in graphic design and using WordPress to develop my first website. 
<br><br>
Learning to code and web design through a self-learning path is not easy. However, it's the creative work that makes me happy and I enjoy bringing ideas to life through browser. It's my pleasure to share it with others!
