# Personal Website V1 ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

Hello! This is my first portfolio website that I built using Hugo when I first started to work as a Web Developer in early 2022. During that period, I mainly used Adobe PhotoShop and Illustrator for design work , Vue.js and React.js for web development.

## Getting started
- `hugo server -D` to start a dev server with draft content
- `hugo` for prod

## Deploy to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions
Reference: [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

Step 1: Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose **Settings** > **Pages**. 

Step 2:
Under title: <em>Build and deployment</em>, change the **Source** to <code>GitHub Actions</code>.

Step 3: Modify the content or create a file <code>.github/workflows/hugo.yaml
</code>

Step 4: Commit the change and push to GitHub.

Let me know what you think!
